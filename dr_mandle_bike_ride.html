<p>Retired Park Nicollet Health Services Internal Medicine Physician Jeffrey Mandel, MD is pedaling across&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">America to raise money and awareness for Park Nicollet Foundation&rsquo;s Growing Through Grief program.</span></p>
<p>The Growing Through Grief program&nbsp; is a school based grief support program that serves children and teens who have experienced the death of a family member or friend. Growing Through Grief staff also provide collaborative crisis management support for death related incidences in the school community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 21 years, the Growing Through Grief program has been supported entirely through philanthropy and provided free of charge to participating schools. Grief counselors collaborate with school staff and teachers to provide support to more than 520 students every week in 72 elementary, middle and high schools located in 13 Minnesota school districts. More than $550,000 in support is needed each year to support this program. Requests from schools for grief and crisis support continues to rise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;Five percent of children in Minnesota, 65,000 kids, will experience the death of a parent,&rdquo; said Dr. Mandel. &ldquo;Grief and loss can impact a child&rsquo;s school attendance, grades, extra-curricular activities, friendships, self-worth and sleep. It can derail a child&rsquo;s development, leading to life-long negative impact. Growing Through Grief offers a stronger future to families, schools and communities struggling to cope with grief and loss.&rdquo;</span></p>
